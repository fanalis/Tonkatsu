# Tonkatsu
C program to download last episode of a manga from mangastream

## Disclaimer
Mangastream page closed, so this is now useless.

## Requirements
- [gumbo-parser](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser)
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)

## Install
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fanalis/c_mangastream_downloader
$ cd https://github.com/fanalis/c_mangastream_downloader
$ make
```

## Usage
```bash
$ ./mangastream-downloader
$ shokugeki no souma
```
This will create a folder `output/shokugeki_no_souma` and download the last episode there

## Advice
This is a "for fun" project. I only made it because i like ~~to suffer with~~ c and wanted to use cURL and gumbo for something.
